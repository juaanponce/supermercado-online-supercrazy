= I want to add a product attribute to the export  =
Check screenshot #5! You should open section "Set up fields", open section "Product order items"(right column), click button "Add field", select field in 1st dropdown, type column title and press button "Confirm".

= Same order was exported many times =
You should open section "Set up fields to export" and set "Fill order columns for" to  "1st row only". The plugin repeats common information for each order item (by default).

= I see only GREEN fields in section "Set up fields"  =
Please, unmark checkbox "Summary Report By Products" (it's below date range)

= Red text flashes at bottom during page loading = 
It's a normal situation. The plugin hides this warning on successful load. 

= I can't filter/export custom attribute for Simple Product =
I'm sorry, but it's impossible. You should add this attribute to Products>Attributes at first and use "Filter by Product Taxonomies".

= How can I add a Gravity Forms field to export? =
Open order, look at items and remember meta name.
Visit WooCommerce>Export Orders,
open section "Set up fields", open section "Product order items"(at right), click button "Add field",
select SAME name in second dropdown (screenshot #5)

= Plugin produces unreadable XLS file =
The theme or another plugin outputs some lines. Usually, there are extra empty lines at the end of functions.php(in active theme).

= I can't export Excel file (blank message or error 500) =
Please, increase "memory_limit" upto 256M or ask hosting support to do it.

= When exporting .csv containing european special characters , I want to open this csv in Excel without extra actions =
You  should open tab "CSV" and set up ISO-8859-1 as codepage.

= Preview shows wrong values,  I use Summary mode =
This button processes only first 5 orders by default, so you should run the export to see correct values.

= Is it compatible with "WooCommerce Custom Orders Table" plugin (by Liquid Web) ? =
No, as we provide a lot of filters which can not be implemented using WooCommerce classes. So we use direct access to database/tables.

= Where does free version save files? = 
Free version doesn't save generated file on your webserver, you can only download it using browser.

= Can I request any new feature ? =
Yes, you can email a request to aprokaev@gmail.com. We intensively develop this plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. Default view after installation.  Just click 'Express Export' to get results.
2. Filter orders by many parameters, not only by order date or status.
3. Select the fields to export, rename labels, reorder columns.
4. Button Preview works for all formats.
